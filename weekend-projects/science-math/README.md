# Science & Math Projects

Hands-on, inquiry-based projects that build first-principles understanding through experimentation and exploration.

## Project Ideas

### 1. Kitchen Science: Variables & Testing

  - Test: Temperature (fridge vs. counter vs. warm spot)
  - Test: Time (4 hours vs. 8 hours vs. 12 hours)
  - Test: Amount of urad dal (different ratios)
  - Observe: Bubbles, smell, volume change, taste difference

- **Curd/Yogurt setting**: How does milk become curd?
  - Test: Temperature of milk when starter added (hot vs. warm vs. cool)
  - Test: Amount of starter (1 spoon vs. 2 spoons)
  - Test: Where you keep it (warm place vs. room temperature)
  - Observe: Time to set, texture, sourness

- **Roti puffing**: Why do some rotis puff up?
  - Test: Thickness (thin vs. thick)
  - Test: Heat level (high vs. medium)
  - Test: Resting time of dough
  - Observe: Steam formation, layering

- **Chai chemistry**: What affects chai taste and color?
  - Test: When to add milk (beginning vs. after boiling vs. end)
  - Test: Boiling time (2 min vs. 5 min vs. 10 min)
  - Test: Tea leaves amount
  - Observe: Color, strength, taste

- **Pickle preservation**: Why don't pickles spoil?
  - Test: Salt amount, oil layer, sun exposure
  - Observe: Why these ingredients prevent spoiling

- **Papad in sun**: What makes papad dry and crispy?
  - Test: Sun vs. shade, time needed, humidity effect
  - Observe: Dehydration process

**Process**:
1. **Observe** the phenomenon naturally in your kitchen
2. **Wonder** what variables might matter
3. **Predict** what will happen
4. **Test** by changing ONE variable at a time
5. **Record** results (photos, notes, measurements)
6. **Explain** why you think it works this way (bacteria? heat? time? chemistry?)

**Parent role**: Help with safety (hot stove, hot milk), but let child drive the questioning

**Why Indian kitchen science?**
- Everyday phenomena child sees regularly
- Fermentation, preservation, chemistry all happening at home
- Connects science to culture and daily life
- Parent likely knows the "traditional wisdom" - can compare with scientific explanation

### 2. Design Challenge: Optimize It
**Skills**: Iterative design, measurement, first principles
**Time**: 60 min

Create something, measure it, improve it:

**Example challenges**:
- **Paper airplane**: What design flies farthest? Why?
  - Make 3 designs
  - Test each 5 times
  - Measure distance
  - Analyze: What features matter? (weight, wing shape, balance)
  - Iterate

- **Bridge building**: Strongest bridge from paper/straws
  - Test: How many books can it hold?
  - Improve: What makes it stronger?

- **Water filter**: Filter dirty water with household materials
  - Test: How clear? How fast?
  - Iterate: Layer order, materials used

**Questions to explore**:
- What made the biggest difference?
- Why did that work better?
- What trade-offs did you make?

### 3. Pattern Hunt: Math in the World
**Skills**: Pattern recognition, mathematical thinking, observation
**Time**: 30-45 min

Find mathematical patterns in everyday life:

**Pattern types**:
- **Symmetry**: In nature (leaves, flowers, butterflies), architecture
- **Spirals**: Shells, plants, galaxies
- **Tessellations**: Tiles, honeycomb, pineapple
- **Fibonacci**: Flower petals, pinecones, spiral patterns
- **Fractals**: Trees, coastlines, snowflakes

**Process**:
1. Go on a pattern hunt (neighborhood walk, photo collection)
2. Document with photos/sketches
3. Analyze: What's repeating? Why might this pattern exist?
4. Recreate: Draw/build your own version
5. Wonder: Where else might this pattern appear?

### 4. Measure & Compare: Real World Math
**Skills**: Measurement, estimation, data analysis
**Time**: 45 min

Pick something to measure and analyze:

**Example projects**:
- **Shadow tracking**: Measure shadow length every hour
  - Graph results
  - Predict tomorrow's pattern
  - Explain why it changes (Earth's rotation)

- **Plant growth**: Measure daily for 2 weeks
  - Graph growth
  - Calculate growth rate
  - Predict future size

- **Efficiency comparison**: Same task, different methods
  - Time each method
  - Calculate which is faster/easier
  - When would you use each?

**Skills developed**:
- Estimation before measuring
- Choosing appropriate units
- Graphing data
- Interpreting trends

### 5. Reverse Engineering: How Does It Work?
**Skills**: First principles, systems thinking, observation
**Time**: 45-60 min

Pick a simple device and figure out how it works:

**Process**:
1. **Observe**: How does it behave?
2. **Sketch**: Draw the parts and how they connect
3. **Hypothesize**: How do you think it works?
4. **Test**: Try it in different ways
5. **Research**: Were you right?
6. **Apply**: What other machines use similar principles?
