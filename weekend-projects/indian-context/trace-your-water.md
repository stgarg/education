# Trace Your Water: From Source to Tap

**Category:** Indian Geography & Systems Thinking
**Skills:** Systems thinking, research, observation, cause-effect reasoning
**Time:** 60 min + optional field visit
**ICSE Alignment:** Rivers of India, Natural Resources, Water Cycle

## Project Overview

Every day you drink water, bathe, wash dishes. But where does that water come from? Trace it backwards from your tap to its source - river, lake, groundwater. Understand the complex system that brings water to millions of people.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this project, the child will:
- Understand water as a SYSTEM, not just "turn on the tap"
- Trace water source for their city/home
- Appreciate complexity and infrastructure needed
- Connect to geography (rivers, dams, watersheds)
- Understand water scarcity issues in India
- Value water more (it's not infinite or free!)

## Process

### Phase 1: Start at Your Tap (10 min)

**Observe:**
- Turn on your tap
- Where does this water come from?
- How does it get to your floor (if in apartment)?
- Who provides it? (Municipal corporation, private supplier, borewell?)

**Initial questions:**
- What's the SOURCE? (River? Lake? Underground?)
- How far away is it?
- How does it travel here?
- How is it made clean/safe?
- What if source runs out?

**Don't research yet** - first record your current understanding and questions

### Phase 2: Research Your City's Water Source (20 min)

**Find out** (ask parents, search online, check your city's water authority website):

**For major cities** (examples):

**Mumbai:**
- **Source:** Mostly from lakes (Vihar, Tulsi, Powai, etc.) + some from rivers (Vaitarna, Ulhas)
- **Distance:** 100+ km in some cases
- **Treatment:** Water treatment plants (Bhandup, Panjrapur)
- **Distribution:** Through pipelines to local areas, then to buildings

**Delhi:**
- **Source:** Yamuna River (60%) + Ganga (through canals) + groundwater
- **Distance:** Ganga water travels 200+ km through canals!
- **Treatment:** Water treatment plants across city
- **Challenge:** Yamuna is heavily polluted - requires heavy treatment

**Bangalore:**
- **Source:** Cauvery River (80+ km away!)
- **Pumping:** Water pumped UPHILL (Bangalore is at higher elevation)
- **Treatment:** Cauvery Water Supply Scheme plants
- **Groundwater:** Many homes also use borewells

**Chennai:**
- **Source:** Multiple sources - Krishna water (from Andhra Pradesh!), local lakes, groundwater
- **Distance:** Krishna water travels 400+ km
- **Challenge:** Frequent water shortage, monsoon-dependent

**Pune:**
- **Source:** Dams on rivers (Khadakwasla, Panshet, Varasgaon, Temghar)
- **Distance:** 20-40 km
- **Treatment:** Treatment plants near dams

**[Your city]:**
- **Source:**
- **Distance:**
- **How it reaches:**
- **Challenges:**

---

### Phase 3: Create a Water Journey Map (20 min)

**Draw a visual map showing water's journey:**

**Step 1: SOURCE**
- Name the river/lake/dam/aquifer
- Mark location on map
- **Geography:** What feeds the source? (Rainfall, snowmelt, monsoon, groundwater recharge)

**Step 2: STORAGE**
- Dam/reservoir (if any)
- Why needed? (Store water for dry season, regulate flow)

**Step 3: TREATMENT**
- Water treatment plants
- **Process:** Filtration, chlorination, testing (make it safe to drink)
- **Why needed:** Remove dirt, bacteria, pollutants

**Step 4: TRANSPORT**
- Pipelines (underground, overhead tanks)
- Pumping stations (if water needs to go uphill)
- **Engineering:** Gravity flow vs. pumping

**Step 5: DISTRIBUTION**
- Local water tanks
- Building tanks
- Your tap!

**Step 6: AFTER USE**
- Where does used water go?
- Drainage → Sewage treatment (hopefully!) → River/sea
- **Loop:** Used water pollutes rivers → same river is source → need more treatment!

**Draw arrows showing the complete loop**

### Phase 4: Systems Thinking - Stakeholders & Issues (15 min)

**Who's involved in this system?**

**1. Nature:**
- Monsoon (provides water to rivers)
- Rivers, groundwater
- Water cycle (evaporation, rain, runoff)

**2. Infrastructure:**
- Dams, pipelines, treatment plants
- Engineers who built and maintain
- Electricity (to pump water)

**3. Government:**
- Water authority/Municipal corporation
- Decides allocation, pricing
- Maintenance responsibility

**4. Farmers:**
- Use river water for irrigation
- May compete with city water needs
- **Conflict:** Agriculture vs. Urban water

**5. Industries:**
- Use large amounts of water
- May pollute water sources
- **Impact:** On available clean water

**6. Citizens:**
- Daily use (drinking, bathing, washing)
- Pay water bills (or do we? Many cities, water is underpriced)
- Waste water (leaking taps, overuse)

**7. Other cities:**
- May share the same river
- **Conflict:** Upstream vs. downstream users
- **Example:** Cauvery water dispute (Karnataka vs. Tamil Nadu)

---

### Phase 5: Challenges & Multiple Perspectives (10 min)

**Identify problems in your city's water system:**

**Common challenges:**
- **Scarcity:** Not enough water for growing population
- **Pollution:** Rivers polluted by sewage, industry
- **Inequality:** Some areas get water daily, others weekly
- **Groundwater depletion:** Too many borewells, water table dropping
- **Climate change:** Erratic monsoons, less predictable rainfall
- **Wastage:** Leaking pipes, overuse
- **Inter-state disputes:** Rivers cross states, who gets how much?

**Multiple perspectives on a water shortage:**

**Government's view:**
- Limited water, need to allocate fairly
- Budget constraints for new infrastructure
- Balancing agriculture, industry, urban needs

**Farmer's view:**
- Need water for crops (livelihood depends on it)
- "Cities waste water, we use it productively"
- Historical rights to river water

**Urban resident's view:**
- Paid taxes, deserve reliable water
- Water is basic right
- Can't afford private tankers

**Environmentalist's view:**
- Rivers need water too (ecosystems, downstream users)
- Over-extraction harms nature
- Need sustainable use

**Industry's view:**
- Need water for production, employment, economy
- Can pay more for water than farmers
- Willing to recycle if incentivized

**Poor community's view:**
- Can't afford tankers or purifiers
- Walk far to get water
- Water inequality is social justice issue

## Why This Project Matters for Indian Context

**Water is THE critical issue in India:**
- ✅ Growing population, limited water
- ✅ Climate change affecting monsoon predictability
- ✅ Groundwater depletion in many areas
- ✅ River pollution widespread
- ✅ Inter-state conflicts over rivers
- ✅ Urban-rural water access inequality

**Understanding water system teaches:**
- Systems thinking (complexity, interconnection)
- Multiple perspectives (stakeholder conflicts)
- Geography application (rivers, monsoon, states)
- Citizenship (shared resources, responsibility)
- Empathy (water inequality)
- First principles (where does it come from? what if source depletes?)

**Every Indian child should understand:**
- Water is NOT infinite
- Your tap water traveled far and was treated by many people
- Monsoon failure = water crisis
- Personal choices (save water) + systemic changes both needed
