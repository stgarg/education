# History & Geography Projects

Projects that develop systems thinking, multiple perspectives, and first-principles understanding of how the world works.

## Project Ideas

### 1. Map Your Local System
**Skills**: Systems thinking, observation, geography
**Time**: 60 min (can be done over multiple weekends)

Choose one system to trace in your neighborhood:
- **Water**: Where does tap water come from? Where does it go?
- **Food**: Where does your milk/vegetables come from? (trace backwards)
- **Waste**: Where does trash go after pickup?
- **Energy**: Where does electricity come from?

**Process**:
- Draw a map showing the system flow
- Mark key locations (source, processing, destination)
- Identify people/roles involved at each stage
- Answer: What if one part breaks?

### 2. Historical Event: Cause & Effect Web
**Skills**: Systems thinking, multiple perspectives, causality
**Time**: 45-60 min

Pick a historical event (from school or interest):
- Create a web/diagram of causes (going back 2-3 levels)
- Show immediate and long-term effects
- Identify different stakeholders and their perspectives
- Mark which effects led to new causes (loops)

**Example topics**:
- Indian Independence (1947)
- Any event from current history lesson
- Local historical event

**Questions to explore**:
- What had to happen BEFORE this could happen?
- Who benefited? Who was harmed?
- What unintended consequences emerged?

### 3. A Day in Their Shoes
**Skills**: Empathy, research, historical thinking
**Time**: 60 min + presentation

Research and present a typical day for someone in a different time/place:
- Choose: Historical period, different culture, different geography
- Research: What did they eat? How did they travel? What was their work?
- Compare: How is it different from your day? Why?
- Present: Create a visual timeline or comic strip

**Extensions**:
- What challenges did they face that we don't?
- What did they have that we've lost?
- How did geography/climate shape their daily life?

### 4. If I Were a City Planner
**Skills**: Systems thinking, multiple perspectives, problem-solving
**Time**: 45-60 min

Pick a real problem in your city/area:
- Traffic congestion
- Lack of green spaces
- Water shortages
- Waste management

**Process**:
- Map the current situation
- Identify stakeholders (who's affected?)
- Propose 3 different solutions
- Analyze trade-offs (who wins? who loses? cost? time?)
- Make a recommendation with reasoning

### 5. Geography Detective: Why Is It Here?
**Skills**: First principles, geographical reasoning
**Time**: 30-45 min

Pick a city/settlement (from atlas or current geography lesson):
- **Observe**: Where is it located? (river, coast, mountains, plains)
- **Question**: Why would people settle HERE specifically?
- **Research**: Was there water? Trade routes? Defense? Resources?
- **Predict**: How would it be different if located elsewhere?

**Compare**: Look at 3 cities in different geographies - what patterns do you see?

### 6. Time Traveler's Perspective
**Skills**: Multiple perspectives, historical empathy, critical thinking
**Time**: 45 min

Pick a historical figure and a moral question they faced:
- Research what they KNEW at the time (not what we know now)
- What were their options?
- What values/beliefs guided them?
- What were consequences?
- How would YOU decide with ONLY their information?

**Reflect**: How does hindsight change judgment? Is that fair?

### 7. Migration Map: Objects Edition
**Skills**: Geography, systems thinking, global connections
**Time**: 45 min

Pick 5 objects in your home:
- Research where each was made
- Map the journey (raw materials → manufacturing → shipping → your home)
- Calculate rough distance traveled
- Identify: Why manufactured there? Why not locally?

**Questions**:
- What does this reveal about global systems?
- What are benefits of this system?
- What are costs (environmental, social)?

## Upcoming Project Ideas

*[Add new projects as you think of them]*

- Historical newspaper: Write news articles from a specific day in history
- Climate comparison: Same latitude, different weather - why?
- Cultural practice deep-dive: Pick one custom, trace its origins and evolution
- Alternative history: What if [key event] happened differently?
