# Literature-Based Projects

Projects that combine love of reading/writing with critical thinking, creativity, and systems thinking.

**Note**: Examples include both universal literature and Indian texts commonly read in ICSE 4th standard (Panchatantra, Ruskin Bond, Indian folk tales, poetry).

## Project Ideas

### 1. Character Decision Tree
**Skills**: Systems thinking, empathy, structured thinking
**Time**: 45-60 min

Map out a key decision point in a story:
- What were the character's options?
- What factors influenced their choice?
- What would have happened with different choices?
- Create a visual decision tree with branches

**Indian literature examples:**
- **Panchatantra story "The Monkey and the Crocodile"**: What were the monkey's options when he realized the crocodile's plan?
- **Folk tale**: Tenali Raman's clever decisions
- **Ruskin Bond story**: A character's choice in "The Blue Umbrella" or "The Cherry Tree"

**Extension**: Apply same thinking to a real decision in your life

### 2. Redesign a Book Cover
**Skills**: First principles, design thinking, audience awareness
**Time**: 30-45 min

Pick a favorite book and redesign the cover:
- Who is the target audience? (age, interests)
- What emotion should it evoke?
- What colors/symbols represent the story?
- Why these choices over others?

**Process**: Sketch 3 different concepts, explain reasoning for each

---

### 3. Rewrite from Another Perspective
**Skills**: Multiple perspectives, empathy, creative writing
**Time**: 45-60 min

Take a scene from a book and rewrite it:
- From a different character's POV
- How does their knowledge differ?
- What do they notice that others don't?
- How does it change the story?

**Extension**: Compare - what stays the same? What changes?

---

### 4. Story Systems Map
**Skills**: Systems thinking, cause-effect reasoning
**Time**: 30-45 min

Create a visual map of how different elements in a story connect:
- Characters (who influences whom?)
- Events (what caused what?)
- Themes (how do they interconnect?)
- Setting (how does it affect the plot?)

Use arrows, colors, labels to show relationships

### 5. Author's Craft Investigation
**Skills**: Critical analysis, first principles
**Time**: 45 min

Pick a powerful scene and analyze the author's choices:
- Why did they start the scene here?
- What details did they include/exclude? Why?
- How did they pace the action?
- What would change if written differently?

**Try it**: Write the same scene with different choices, compare impact

### 6. Panchatantra: Moral Analysis & Modern Application
**Skills**: Critical thinking, ethical reasoning, application to real life
**Time**: 45 min
**ICSE Alignment**: Common text in 4th standard

Panchatantra stories are ancient Indian fables with morals. But are the morals always right? Let's think critically!

**Process:**

**1. Read/Recall a Panchatantra story** (examples):
- The Monkey and the Crocodile
- The Brahmin and the Goat
- The Lion and the Rabbit
- The Crows and the Serpent

**2. Identify the traditional moral:**
- What lesson does the story teach?
- Who is presented as wise? Who as foolish?

**3. Critical analysis:**
- Do you agree with this moral? Why or why not?
- Are there situations where this moral might NOT apply?
- What values does the moral prioritize? (Cleverness, loyalty, caution, etc.)
- Whose perspective is the story told from? How might it change from another character's view?

**4. Modern application:**
- Can you think of a similar situation in modern life?
- Would the same solution work today? Why or why not?
- What's changed? What stays the same?

**5. Alternative moral:**
- What other lesson could be drawn from the same story?
- Rewrite the ending with a different moral

**Example: "The Monkey and the Crocodile"**
- **Traditional moral**: "Presence of mind and intelligence can help you get out of difficult situations"
- **Questions**: Is it okay that the monkey lied to the crocodile? Was the crocodile foolish to trust his wife? What about betraying friendship?
- **Alternative moral**: "Don't betray friends for personal gain" (Crocodile's wife) or "Be honest in friendships"
- **Modern parallel**: Peer pressure situations, online safety

**Deliverable**:
- Create a comparison chart: Traditional moral vs. Your interpretation vs. Modern application
- OR: Rewrite the story in a modern setting (school, city, etc.)
