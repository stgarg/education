# Multiple Perspectives Game

**Time:** 5-10 minutes
**When:** Discussing current events, stories, school incidents
**Skill Focus:** Empathy, systems thinking, pluralistic worldview

## The Practice

Pick any event from the day (school incident, news, story from a book) and deliberately view it from 3+ different stakeholder perspectives.

## How It Works

1. Identify an event or situation
2. List the stakeholders/characters involved
3. For each one, ask: "How would THEY see this? What would THEY care about?"
4. Notice where perspectives conflict and why

## Question Starters

- "How would [X] feel about this?"
- "What would [Y] want to happen?"
- "Why might [Z] disagree with [X]?"
- "What does [X] know that [Y] doesn't?"
- "What's at stake for each person?"

## Example Scenarios

### Example 1: School Incident
**Event**: Teacher announces surprise test

**Perspectives:**
- **Students**: Stressed, feel unfair, worried about grades, need time to prepare
- **Teacher**: Wants to check understanding, concerned some students aren't doing homework, accountable for learning outcomes
- **Parents**: Want child to succeed, concerned about stress vs. preparedness
- **Principal**: Balancing academic rigor with student wellbeing, teacher autonomy

**Insights**: Everyone wants learning, but different priorities and information

### Example 2: From Literature
**Event**: (Example from any book) Character makes a controversial decision

**Perspectives:**
- Main character: What they knew at the time, their fears, values
- Supporting character: How it affects them, their relationship
- Antagonist: Why they oppose it, their valid concerns
- Reader: With hindsight and complete information

### Example 3: Current Events/Geography
**Event**: New highway being built

**Perspectives:**
- Commuters: Faster travel, time saved
- Local residents: Noise, pollution, property value
- Business owners: More customers vs. construction disruption
- Environment: Habitat loss, carbon emissions
- City planner: Economic growth, budget constraints

## Parent Modeling Tips

- **Model this in your own life**: "At work today, I saw this from my manager's perspective..."
- **Avoid "right vs wrong"**: Focus on "different needs and priorities"
- **Connect to books**: "Let's think about why the villain believes they're right..."
- **Use real family decisions**: "Grandma wants X, you want Y, I want Z - why?"

## Advanced Variations

- **Time perspectives**: How would someone view this 100 years ago vs. today vs. 100 years from now?
- **Cultural perspectives**: How might this be viewed in different cultures?
- **Scale perspectives**: Individual vs. community vs. global impact

## Integration with Literature

Use this with EVERY story your child reads:
- "Why did the character do that? What did they care about?"
- "Who benefited? Who was hurt?"
- "If the story was told from [other character's] view, how would it change?"
