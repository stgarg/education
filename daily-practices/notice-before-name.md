# Notice Before Name

**Time:** 5 minutes
**When:** Before homework, during walks, free moments
**Skill Focus:** Observation, inquiry, scientific thinking

## The Practice

Pick any object, creature, or phenomenon. Spend 2 minutes OBSERVING without naming or explaining. Then discuss what you noticed and why it might be that way.

## The Rule

**Don't start with labels.** Start with pure observation.

- ❌ "That's a sparrow. Sparrows are small birds that..."
- ✅ "I notice it's hopping, not walking. Its head moves very quickly. I wonder why..."

## How It Works

1. **Choose something** - a bird, plant, building, utensil, cloud, anything
2. **Observe for 2 minutes**:
   - What do you SEE? (shape, color, movement, patterns)
   - What is it DOING? (behavior, function)
   - What do you NOTICE? (details others might miss)
3. **Ask why**: Why might it be designed/evolved this way?
4. **Then** look up the name and explanation

## Observation Prompts

- "What shapes do you see?"
- "What colors? Are they uniform or varied?"
- "Is it moving? How?"
- "What patterns repeat?"
- "What's surprising or unexpected?"
- "What does it remind you of?"

## Example Observations

### Example 1: Bird on Window Sill
**Observations:**
- Hops instead of walks (why not walk?)
- Head jerks side to side rapidly (why?)
- Feathers have multiple colors in patterns (purpose?)
- Skinny legs, no visible knees (how does it bend?)
- Eyes on side of head, not front (what can it see?)

**Questions that emerge:**
- Why do birds hop? (Related to body structure, energy efficiency)
- Why the rapid head movement? (Fixed eye position, need to move head to see)
- Why patterns? (Camouflage, mate attraction)

**Then research:** Oh, it's a [species name], which does X because Y

### Example 2: Kitchen Utensil (Whisk)
**Observations:**
- Multiple thin wires in a loop shape
- Wires are curved, not straight
- Handle is thicker than wires
- Flexible but returns to shape

**Questions:**
- Why many thin wires instead of one thick one? (Surface area)
- Why loops? (Traps air, creates volume)
- Why flexible? (Reaches corners, adapts to bowl shape)

**Then discuss:** Design follows function - mixing needs to incorporate air and cover area

### Example 3: During Geography Lesson
**Before naming**: Look at a river on a map
- It's curved, not straight
- Curves get bigger in flat areas
- Multiple rivers join into bigger ones
- It's wider at the end than beginning

**Questions:**
- Why curved? (Water erodes unevenly, path of least resistance)
- Why does it widen? (More water collected from tributaries)

**Then learn**: Concepts like meandering, tributaries, confluence

## Parent Modeling Tips

- **Do this yourself out loud**: "Hm, I'm noticing this door handle is curved... I wonder why not straight..."
- **Resist the urge to teach**: Let observation and questions come first
- **Celebrate noticing**: "Great observation! I didn't notice that!"
- **Model uncertainty**: "I honestly don't know why. Let's think about it..."

## Why This Matters

This builds **scientific thinking**:
1. Observe without bias
2. Notice patterns
3. Generate hypotheses
4. Then seek explanations

It's the opposite of: "Here's the name and definition. Memorize it."

## Integration with School Subjects

**Science**: Before reading about photosynthesis, observe plants for a week
**Geography**: Before learning about ecosystems, observe a small area intensely
**History**: Before dates and names, observe artifacts, photos, primary sources
**Math**: Before formulas, observe patterns in numbers, shapes

## Variations

- **Blind observation**: Describe something by touch only, then look at it
- **Comparison observation**: Observe two similar things, notice differences
- **Change over time**: Observe same thing daily for a week
