# Structured Thinking Framework

**Time:** 5-15 minutes
**When:** Homework discussions, family decisions, problem-solving
**Skill Focus:** Organizing thoughts, clear communication, analytical thinking

## The Framework: KTW

A simple three-part structure for organizing ANY discussion, problem, or writing:

1. **K - What do I KNOW?** (Facts, observations, data)
2. **T - What do I THINK?** (Analysis, opinions, interpretations)
3. **W - What do I WONDER?** (Questions, uncertainties, what's next)

## Why This Matters

- Separates facts from opinions (critical thinking)
- Shows what's certain vs. uncertain (intellectual humility)
- Generates new questions (curiosity)
- Creates structure for clear communication

## How to Use It

### For Homework/Reading
**Instead of**: "Summarize the chapter"

**Use KTW**:
- **Know**: What happened in the story? What are the facts?
- **Think**: Why did the character do that? What's the theme?
- **Wonder**: What will happen next? Why did the author choose this setting?

### For Science/Math
**Instead of**: "Solve the problem"

**Use KTW**:
- **Know**: What information is given? What formulas apply?
- **Think**: What approach should I use? Why?
- **Wonder**: What if the numbers were different? Why does this method work?

### For Family Discussions
**Instead of**: "What do you think we should do?"

**Use KTW**:
- **Know**: What are the facts of the situation?
- **Think**: What are our options? What are pros/cons?
- **Wonder**: What don't we know yet? What could go wrong?

## Examples

### Example 1: History Lesson (Mughal Empire)
**KNOW:**
- Ruled India from 1526-1857
- Akbar was known for religious tolerance
- Built Taj Mahal
- Eventually defeated by British

**THINK:**
- Religious tolerance was unusual for that time - maybe that's why empire was stable?
- Architecture shows wealth and power
- British defeat might be related to internal weaknesses

**WONDER:**
- Why did religious tolerance end with later rulers?
- What did daily life look like for common people?
- How did Indian culture influence Mughal culture and vice versa?

### Example 2: Math Problem (Pattern recognition)
**Problem**: 2, 4, 8, 16, ... What comes next?

**KNOW:**
- Numbers are getting bigger
- 2, 4, 8, 16 are all even numbers
- Each number seems to be double the previous one

**THINK:**
- Pattern is multiply by 2
- Next number should be 32
- This is exponential growth, not linear

**WONDER:**
- Why is this pattern common in nature?
- What happens if we keep going? Does it break at some point?
- Are there other patterns that could fit these numbers?

### Example 3: Science (Plant observation)
**KNOW:**
- Plant by window is leaning toward light
- Leaves are green
- Needs water and sun
- Has roots in soil

**THINK:**
- Plant must be moving toward light for a reason (energy/food)
- Green color might be related to how it uses sunlight
- Roots + water + sun = something important happening

**WONDER:**
- How does plant "know" where light is?
- Why are leaves green specifically, not other colors?
- What happens to water inside the plant?

## Parent Modeling

Use KTW in your own decisions (say it out loud):

**Choosing a vacation spot:**
- **Know**: "We have 5 days, budget of X, everyone wants beach or mountains"
- **Think**: "Beach is closer and cheaper, but we went there last time. Mountains offer new experience"
- **Wonder**: "What's the weather like that time of year? Are there good family-friendly options?"

**Work problem:**
- **Know**: "Project is due Friday, I have X resources, client wants Y"
- **Think**: "I can deliver Y but quality might suffer, or deliver Z with higher quality"
- **Wonder**: "What does client value more - speed or quality? Should I ask?"

## Writing with KTW

This framework works for essays, reports, creative writing:

**Introduction**: Set up what we KNOW
**Body**: Develop what we THINK (analysis, arguments)
**Conclusion**: Address what we WONDER (implications, questions for future)

## Advanced Variations

### KTWA (Add Action)
- **A - What will I DO?** (Next steps, decisions)

### Collaborative KTW
- Each family member contributes to each section
- Notice how people's "Think" differs even with same "Know"

### Debate KTW
- **Know**: Both sides agree on these facts
- **Think**: Where do interpretations differ?
- **Wonder**: What evidence would change our minds?

## Practice Prompts

Use these to practice the framework:
- "Let's KTW your day at school"
- "KTW what you're reading"
- "KTW this family decision"
- "KTW what you learned in [subject]"

## Integration Tips

Make this a **household language**:
- "What do we KNOW for sure?"
- "That's what you THINK - what's the evidence?"
- "Great WONDER question!"
