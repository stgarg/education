# Learning Through First Principles & Inquiry

## Project Theme

This is a home enrichment framework designed to complement formal schooling by bridging gaps between traditional curriculum and inquiry-based, critical thinking approaches. The goal is to develop deep understanding, systems thinking, and pluralistic worldviews through daily micro-practices and hands-on projects.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Depth over Breadth** - Understand concepts deeply rather than collecting surface facts
2. **First Principles Thinking** - Ask "why" before "what"; observe before naming
3. **Inquiry-Based Exploration** - Curiosity drives learning, not just curriculum
4. **Structured Thinking** - Organize thoughts clearly in discussion and writing
5. **Systems Thinking** - See connections, patterns, and interdependencies
6. **Empathy & Pluralism** - Multiple perspectives, worldviews, and experiences
7. **Learning by Doing** - Hands-on projects and experiments

## Key Principle: Parents as Models

Children mirror their parents. All practices here are designed for both parent and child to practice together. When parents model curiosity, structured thinking, and first-principles reasoning, children absorb it naturally.

## Structure

- **`daily-practices/`** - 5-15 minute activities woven into routine (dinner, commute, homework time)
- **`weekend-projects/`** - 30-60 minute hands-on, project-based learning activities
- **`templates/`** - Reusable templates for creating new activities
- **`parent-practices/`** - Guidance for parents to model behaviors
- **`tracking/`** - Weekly planners and reflection tools

## How to Use This

1. Start with ONE daily practice for 1-2 weeks
2. When it feels natural, add a second practice
3. Introduce weekend projects after a month
4. Use templates to create your own activities based on current interests
5. Keep iterating - add notes, modify activities, create new ones

## Target Learner Profile

- 4th Standard (ICSE board)
- Loves literature, languages, history, geography
- Interested in science and math
- Active and curious
- Limited time due to school schedule

## Indian Context Integration

This framework has been **deeply customized for Indian families**:
- ✅ Multilingualism (daily practice + integrated throughout)
- ✅ Indian kitchen science (dosa, curd, chai, roti, etc.)
- ✅ ICSE 4th standard curriculum alignment
- ✅ Indian social realities (diversity, privilege, domestic help, joint families)
- ✅ Indian literature (Panchatantra, Ruskin Bond, folk tales, regional diversity)
- ✅ Indian geography (monsoons, rivers, festivals, regional diversity)
- ✅ Indian history (Indus Valley, appropriate for 4th standard)
- ✅ Indian family contexts (joint families, multilingualism, festivals)

**Key India-specific resources:**
- `indian-context-review.md` - Detailed review of Indian contextualization
- `weekend-projects/indian-context/` - Monsoons, festivals, Indus Valley, water systems
- `icse-curriculum-integration.md` - Direct mapping to ICSE curriculum
- `daily-practices/multilingual-thinking.md` - Leveraging India's linguistic diversity
