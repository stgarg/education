# Getting Started Guide

**Welcome!** This guide will help you begin implementing this enrichment framework with your child.

---

## Quick Start: Your First Two Weeks

### Week 1: Establish ONE Daily Practice

**Goal:** Make one practice feel natural before adding more

**Recommended starter:** Why Chain
- Easiest to integrate into existing conversations
- Requires no special setup
- Immediate engagement

**Implementation:**
1. **Read:** `daily-practices/why-chain.md`
2. **Parent preparation:** Practice "thinking aloud" yourself for 2-3 days
3. **Introduce naturally:** At dinner/car ride, when something comes up, start asking "why?"
4. **Aim for:** 3-4 times this week, 5-10 minutes each

**Don't:**
- Force it if child is tired/resistant
- Worry about "doing it perfectly"
- Add other practices yet

### Week 2: Solidify & Add Parent Modeling

**Goal:** Make Week 1 practice more consistent + add parent modeling

**Continue:** Why Chain practice
**Add:** Pick ONE parent modeling behavior
- Suggested: "Embrace I don't know"
- Review: `parent-practices/modeling-guide.md`

**Track:** Use `tracking/weekly-planner.md` to record what happens

## Month 1: Build Foundation

### Week 1-2: ONE Daily Practice
*(See above)*

### Week 3: Add Second Daily Practice
**Choose based on child's strengths:**
- Loves stories/people → Multiple Perspectives
- Curious about nature/objects → Notice Before Name
- Needs homework help → Structured Thinking (KTW)

### Week 4: First Weekend Project
**Keep it simple:**
- Choose from child's strongest interest area (literature/history/science/empathy)
- Pick a shorter project (30-40 min)
- Suggested starters:
  - Literature lover → "Character Decision Tree"
  - History/Geography interest → "Map Your Local System" (pick water or food)
  - Science/Math curious → "Kitchen Science" (one simple experiment)
  - Empathy focus → "Interview Project" (family member)

**Review project ideas:**
- `weekend-projects/literature-based/README.md`
- `weekend-projects/history-geography/README.md`
- `weekend-projects/science-math/README.md`
- `weekend-projects/empathy-pluralism/README.md`

### End of Month 1: First Reflection
**Complete:** `tracking/monthly-reflection.md`
- What worked?
- What didn't?
- What to adjust?

---

## Month 2-3: Deepen & Customize

### Build Consistency
- 2-3 daily practices feel natural
- 2-3 weekend projects per month
- Parent modeling is becoming habitual

### Start Customizing
**Create your own activities:**
- Use `templates/daily-activity-template.md`
- Use `templates/project-template.md`
- Base on child's current interests/school topics

### Integration
- Connect practices to current schoolwork
- Weave into existing routines (homework, meals, outings)
- Look for spontaneous teaching moments

---

## Month 4-6: Internalization

### Goal
Practices become family culture, not separate "activities"

### Signs of Success
- Child asks "why" questions unprompted
- Child uses KTW framework without prompting
- Child considers multiple perspectives naturally
- Family conversations are richer
- Parent modeling is automatic

### Evolve
- Create new practices based on emerging needs
- Design projects around child's passionate interests
- Experiment and iterate

---

## Implementation Principles

### 1. Start Small
One practice > Ambitious plans that don't happen

### 2. Be Consistent
3x/week for 2 months > Daily for 1 week then stop

### 3. Follow Interest
Child's genuine curiosity > Prescribed curriculum

### 4. Parent First
Model the behavior before expecting it from child

### 5. Adapt Freely
These are frameworks, not scripts. Customize everything.

### 6. Celebrate Process
Focus on quality of thinking, not "right answers"

---

## Troubleshooting

### "My child isn't interested"
- Are you modeling the behavior yourself?
- Is timing right? (Not when tired/hungry/stressed)
- Is it connected to something they care about?
- Are you asking questions vs. lecturing?
- Try a different practice - maybe better fit

### "I don't have time"
- Start with 5 min practices, not 15 min
- Weave into existing time (meals, commute) vs. adding new time
- Do weekend projects every other week, not every week
- One practice consistently > Multiple sporadically

### "I'm not doing it right"
- There is no "right" - only what works for YOUR child
- Experiments and failures are valuable data
- Read the practice notes, but then make it your own

### "Child resists structured thinking"
- Don't force the framework language (KTW)
- Model it yourself without requiring child to use it
- Make it conversational, not a homework assignment
- Try a different practice that matches child's natural style

### "Progress is slow"
- This is cultural change, not skill training - it takes months
- Look for small signs (one good question, one observation)
- Parent modeling often shows results before direct teaching
- Keep monthly reflections to see progress over time

## When to Add More

**Add a new daily practice when:**
- Current practice feels automatic (4+ weeks usually)
- Child or parent initiates it without reminder
- You have capacity and energy

**Add more weekend projects when:**
- Child asks to do them
- You've done 4-5 successfully
- You have time and interest

**Create custom content when:**
- Child has specific passionate interest
- School topic could use reinforcement
- You notice a gap in existing practices
- You have an idea you're excited about

## Remember

**This is a marathon, not a sprint.**

The goal is not to complete all activities, but to cultivate a way of thinking that becomes second nature. Be patient with yourself, your child, and the process.

**Quality over quantity.**
**Consistency over perfection.**
**Interest over obligation.**
