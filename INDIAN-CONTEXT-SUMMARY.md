## Principles Maintained

Throughout the Indian contextualization, we maintained:

✅ **First principles thinking** - Still core
✅ **Inquiry-based learning** - Not didactic
✅ **Systems thinking** - Applied to Indian systems
✅ **Multiple perspectives** - Enhanced by Indian diversity
✅ **Empathy & pluralism** - More relevant with Indian context
✅ **Parent modeling** - Adapted for Indian families
✅ **Practical & doable** - Still 5-15 min daily, 30-60 min weekends

---

## What Makes This Different

**Not just "Indianized"** (replacing names/places)
**But truly "Indian Context"** (using India's unique features as teaching opportunities)

Examples:
- ❌ "Instead of sparrow, use crow" (superficial)
- ✅ "Use monsoon to teach systems thinking" (deep integration)

- ❌ "Add Gandhi to examples" (tokenistic)
- ✅ "Analyze Panchatantra critically, connect to modern life" (meaningful)

- ❌ "Mention festivals" (superficial)
- ✅ "Compare festivals across India to teach empathy and geography" (integrated)

---

**Please customize further:**
- Add your city's specific details
- Add your child's school's specific ICSE texts
- Add your family's regional traditions
- Add your languages
- Adjust sensitivity levels for your child's age/maturity

**File your notes in:**
- Each activity's "Notes & Observations" section
- Monthly reflection tracking
- Create new files as needed

## Questions to Consider

As you use this framework:

1. What Indian context is still missing for YOUR family?
2. What ICSE topics does your child's school emphasize that need more support?
3. What regional/linguistic/cultural specificity can you add?
4. What's working well? What needs adjustment?

Document in your tracking files and iterate!
